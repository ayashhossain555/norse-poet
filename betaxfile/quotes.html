It takes a lots of courage to suicide,
But I am not in their favour who quits.

Even if you think that your life doesn't worth much then stop living for yourself,
Go out in search for them who needs that life...


........



The heart which don't have any selfishness,
Don't have any envy,
Don't have any pride,
Don't have any regret,
Don't have any luxary,
Don't have any disregard,
That heart which understand others is the heart with happiness and peace.

Some unprepared gifts are warmer than some mild ridicule.
Of course it is a gift,
Or else how many laughs in vain laughing at the ridicule with a ridiculous smile.

" The reason you cried so happily and smiled so sadly , was because your heart had grown far beyond you "
- Radwhimps ( Nandemonaiya )

I am just free in words
Imprisoned in those meanings,
I write blue poetry in my consciousness,
And in that, with depression the treaty was signed.


........


What else to do

Nothing...

Stays away all the time from her

Keeping her away

If I bring it closer, the hope of getting it decreases

Then feels satisfied.

After that she looses her value

Then I neglect.


........


I am a solitary poet,
If the poet don't give give birth of new poems,
If he share his words in light and darkness,
Then will he be remain as a poet?
Or will he take a new name , a new path,
With a new hope...


........


How much I was treated with great disgust,
And how badly I was moved ...
I was already broken,
Now smiling with a broken heart...


........


I am dormant in that time and space ,
And it was closed in love...


........


Love only loves her,
Who loves to love and bind with loves.
So, I love , I love her
Who stays by my side and who cares,
Who make me smile everyday...


........


Oh reality, release me,
I want the taste of dream.
Why do you give me silent tears on the darkest night?
I want the love of my beloved.
I don't want to burn myself like a pack of cigarette.


........


How will you know about the sadness of this broken poet,
Only if you fall in love and rise in depire...


........


Poetry is our habit,
Don't think it our foolishness.
I was also someone's habit,
Now look at me sweetheart
I am drowning in wine,
And suffocating in despire...
