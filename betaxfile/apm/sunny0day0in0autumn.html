    <div class="section"><pre><h4>Autumn wanted to be sunny ... but couldn't!
Alas !!
We are so frustrated !!
In the sky, when we get a chance in the air,
Our sighs still spread like darkness !!
Then take a direct bus through Abyss to Olympus to the bay of the road,
They flutter their wings !!
The wings have been shown solely to give a sense of proportion.
Then no one keeps that news !!

Our winter sun could not be!

But the burning wings of lad -
Just saying 'done' is less said!
The sun himself, he has standed with his wing spread !
God has brought out the skin, blood, flesh and brain of the society.
Turning to the spring festival he has mixed the sun!
By removing a heavy screen, showing the sun to everyone with a finger in the eye!
Innumerable bodies,
He has painted the sun of different colors in his mind !!


Intense on the face of society to sniff the shiny facewash
He spread in disgust,
The sun has spread!
Suddenly, behind the thick make-up on the face of the society,
The black spots covered more brightly in that sun !!


It's not that I don't love you, it's just that I don't love you anymore.
It is heard in the bay of that road ...
In our lovely living room, in the quiet rock chat,
On the hotel lawn,
In the coffee cup filled with coffee in the coffee house,
In the face of political personalities, on the posters of their supporters -
Or
In the house of a Bengali who wants to listen to Lalon's songs anew !!


But if society does not want,
Looks like all that sounds pretty crap to me,
Like the sun the society is aint for me.
We could immerse ourselves in one mind,
See the cloudy sky and sing 'The moon rose in the sky' !!


But no!
This sun does not lose!
It is better to say,
We do not let this sun be lost!
Big genuine sunshine to like this!
We constantly chase and enjoy such innumerable suns !!
Even if it is behind the clouds,
Even if it is behind us, we will pull it out from inside !!
Then,
This sunshine became manifested in self-glory !!


We rejoice more,
In more intense hatred,
In more uncertainty, in more disbelief,
In more dependence, in more stupidity,
In more laziness, in more antiquity,
In my own helplessness, in my own non-existence,
So I have to run away.


Then...
Then really
I was surprised to see,
There is no shortage of sunshine in our civilized society !!!
We discovered millions of slanders in a blink of an eye
Instead of a slander of the cruel society !!
As if we are the sun ...
Yes, the sun is ours!


We spread the new wings all over the sky with our pearls !!
They are like diamonds in the sun now ...
Starting from social media, TV screens, roads, shore, forests,
All of them spread like wildfire, I started spreading, I am still spreading !!!


I have seen many famous people of our civil society
Who have discovered and spread all
The so-called horrible obscene phrases more easily than the ray of sun !!

Who will stop our sunrise?

I saw - we are almost all in language,
In the expression of expressions
Openly became the sun !!

This is what God wanted, let the ray of sun be scattered !! Isn't it ??

Us
Autmn wanted to be sunny ... got it!?! </h4></pre></div>
