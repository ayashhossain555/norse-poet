O beloved, do you know the news of love?
In a happy dream.
Why spend the day pretending to be sad?
Love is yours
Love doesn't understand without you.
Do not greave the day morning evening,
Do you have any thoughts?
Beloved without love din't cares?
Beloved, you do not understand anything?

It is still too late for the red letters to burn
Beloved has also lost neighbors for a long time.
No lines were written from the her enemy.
Hate and love for tomorrow's men spends your time.
But after finding his's arm, he returned to her area.


The union of him and her is that tree of churning the sea
One clove chapter was added to the ride.
The midday rush is getting longer and longer,
Signaling the endless footsteps of the immortal anecdote journey.
When she woke up, she found his arm and returned to her heart.

Does he understand her?
She doesn't understand his pain.
Somewhere in the morning,
She seems to be lost in the pages of history.
Since then, he has not spend the day in the morning and evening.
The shores of emptiness are also deserted and lost on the sea shore.

Beloved, you are the papiya of the night, the flute player
Dear, you are the cuckoo of the day,
The fog of the morning, the silver sun
You are the essense of the necter,
Dearest , you have flooded the beautiful rainbow,
You have subdued the beauty!
Beloved, you are the name of your lover -
The name is love, the glory of love. </h4></pre></div>
