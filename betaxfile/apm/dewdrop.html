    <div class="section"><pre><h4>My dewdrop -
She is my abstract poem
Sleep dreams
Or
Dream sleeps
Seeing the agility of the yellow veil, it seems,
Dewdrop ! dewdrop!
She is the verse of my ignorant poem
The red sea in her eyes drew my heart
I am drowning in her lucid death dream
I dream of a distant land of blue stars
Like the light of the full moon in the sky, or,
The flame that flashes all over the place
She is my tribute to that crop
Her watery vision is in the picture of the mind
The suffix of imagination in the solitary moonlight of deep night solitude
Dewdrop scented like bleeding flower-
And they shine in the sky of worldly desires
Where sleep and wakefulness are the same thing.
I have been watching since I woke up
Awakening is like sleeping
Or desolate sleep like waking up
And dewdrop is like sleep
And the dream is just like the assumption
Or my longing is like a dream
And poetry is like conjecture.
Her dreaminess,
That's my dewdrop,
My dewdrop .. </h4></pre></div>
