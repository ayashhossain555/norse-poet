                Colored leaves.

Just hoping for the leaves of
                 poinciana.

In the spring she built her small house,
I'm left with that shadowy fog,
Whose name she is calling from sitting away?
I wonder if the name is mine?

If there is anything left to give her,
Will she keep standing and open the door?

This existence of white and gray is mine,
Waiting for her warm touch.

I don't know who will find the fog in the spring,
Yet I hope to get you. </h4></pre></div>
