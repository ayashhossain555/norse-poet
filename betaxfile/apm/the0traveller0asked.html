    <div class="section"><pre><h4>The restless mind is the secret of separation, in the broken body
Red roses, in tears.
I saw it with a delightful eye, in my heart,
Alas! Are you so?
What I thought at the moment.

Newborn flowers thinks alone, secretly,
The sinful soul is on the sweet step,
Flying bird said,
Friend, who are you calling?
Alas! Are you so?
Remembered what I thought.

Stubborn angel with a kind heart,
Drinking the sea,
Girl with bright eyes, in the rain,
I heard a voice bluntly slow, far away in the chest,
Alas! Are you so?
What I thought, in acceleration.

Hated snake with resent, with sweet poison,
Putting the holy book aside, I asked
What else have you read?
In the evening, snake, is she a palanquin? What do you want?
Alas! Are you so?
Which will solve the number of this life.

With belowy taers the river is flowing,
Stop, O river, the lake outside, the poet drinks,
We wrote love letters everywhere, secretly,
Alas! Are you so?
Which will end this love story. </h4></pre></div>
