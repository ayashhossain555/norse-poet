    <div class="section"><pre><h4>I am a lonely being,
I'm an inferior human,
This mind is not just tainted,
This mind is my male monster.

My deformed brain,
All the sewer thoughts,
All the wicked worms,
This consciousness that resides.

My black blood flows in the arteries,
This is not the body, the rotten flesh ball
Sadness, suffering, pain is my companion,
Moore loves love.

This is not the eye, the vulture's vision
Eats away maiden's heart ,,
This is not the heart, the trap of love
I only know the body, not your love.

I want that tenderness of the breast,
Not love at the end of the day,
I want the nectar of your heavenly well,
Not your sweet kiss.

Yes, I am a dog, I am inhuman
In this closed cell,
In the city of words, I am silent
Love is my cannabis addiction.

I am ugly, I am a sinner
All your tears
Not just violent, I am a demon
I am your rapist.
I'm lost
I'm scared, just skeptical,
Find me, I want to go back
My identity will match your love. </h4></pre></div>
