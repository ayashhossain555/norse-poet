    <div class="section"><pre><h4>I sat on the brink of destruction
Almost soaked in horror,
Woe to the wicked woman,
And some breath left in molded heart
And some mistakes.

This is the advent of any period
This is the call of a night poem,
And how many blue sentences will be composed
He is speechless even though he is a poet.

Today you are dressed in new colors
Wake up in a new sense,
How much ink is still dry, almost sand,
How many torn pages still
Trying to reach the,
Halfway through the story. </h4></pre></div>
