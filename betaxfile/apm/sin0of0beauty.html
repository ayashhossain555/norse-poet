Your perfection,
Looks ridiculous on my fate.

Unsolicited I desire love
All my hopes,
Matches your colour,
Brings you closer.

And if for some moments
I want you to remember me,
Remember I was luxurious with love
Not as today I am poor with grief
I want to see.

If I become a slave
You are my prayer
If I become a lover
You are the beautiful love

You are thinking of mine in the last watch
I'm your morning's thought
If you get me tied with you
I would love to stay in the hell

Don't look at me with those eyes anymore
Don't bind me in your beauty
Yesterday I was just a sinner
You made me a criminal today... </h4></pre></div>
