Everything there is so negligible!
But I can give it to you if you want
Love wrapped in two fingers, a handful of dreams
And some latent feelings.

You hear , Darkness!
I have nothing more to give you,
I have some unfinished poems about you
My unspoken words written in blue notes thinking of you,
Some afternoon full of silence.

I have nothing more to give you,
Darkness.
There is no such thing as giving you expensive surprises over the weekend,
Or the ability to pay your for your dresses or jewelry at the end of the month!

But Darkness,
That's all I can do for you,
Putting my head on your lap,
Eating a pack of nuts and salt every afternoon,
In a unknown road,
Walking side by side at night to soak in the lunar moonlight.
With two leaf tip, one stick kajal, some roses
Dozens of blue bangles, a blue sari and more
Lying in a small hut, on the floor of cold ground,
To get to bed,
To bring you happiness in a sleepless city.
Darkness,
I have nothing more to give you,
Everything there is is negligible!
I'll give it to you if you want ... </h4></pre></div>
