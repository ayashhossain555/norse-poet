Beloved, do you think of me anymore?
I will go to your house,
Dear,
Do you think of me anymore ...?
Dearest
Under that big old tree,
I played in school then
I sit on a bench and do math in a small class room
Sister's groom with sister outside
I was in tenth grade then I was child then
Talked with her at Sulekha's house,
She was good at reading and writing
My color was black when I travel from the city
to seeing you soon, I ran to home
An old man worked in my father's shop
The sweets was still boiling by him,
I make mistakes in math while reading in the evening.
I was in tenth grade then I was sixteen then
I went to see her ,
Hiding under the bridge

Precious after so many days
Honestly, I still remember those things
You said amny things, said who was your lover?
I only have one day with you and you have him.
I saw that wonderful light under the bridge,
I admit that the two of them had a good day
She covered my eyes and filled my chest,
I came home and said goodbye to them.
At night I weny to sleep in the first floor room
The moonlight fell on the bed leaves on the floor
The sister who was after me was on the sidelines
I don't know who she was with today
Today, what will happen tomorrow,
Saturn in tomorrow's hope
Yet fire, where is the burning fire in the water
What if I'm a spoiled boy!
Why do I think today,
She will go to your house.
Beloved,
Do you think about me anymore? </h4></pre></div>
