    <div class="section"><pre><h4>Oh goddess
You have blended into my existence
You existed in my dream
You're in this ridiculous house
I don't know if you will be by my side
Yet in this mind you are forever

Oh empress
The word is mine
The meaning you
Still
I failed to tell...

Oh sleeping girl
if you have to come
Why didin't you came before?
I regret that
I haven't met my fate before
Yet since you came here,
All my love to give you
Because you are my first.

Oh darling
On both sides of your cheek
That shy red glow,
To my ridicule
Subdued in your love
And hopefully the light of your laughter.

Oh precious
The last afternoon of white autumn
If I stand with a yellow rose in your name
Will you come as a goddess after wearing a blue saree?
Become the last light of this afternoon?

Oh beloved
I did all the love
Now the answer is yours
I wrote the beginning of the poem
Now the ending is yours. </h4></pre></div>
