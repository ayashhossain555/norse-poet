    <div class="section"><pre><h4>Silent aspirations unmoved
Obsessed with the appealing sweet scent of the bee forest;
The artistically awaited watches are exhausted,
Unconscious immersion in the art of love vibration.

The half moon plays in the light and darkness
Goes to kiss the intense dreamy lips of the peacock feather;
The blue haired goddess in the guise of monasticism at one o'clock
Despire is drowning in the sleep of great reunion in austerities.

To the tender tune in the joy of the young dew of the morning
Guy, O lover of love --- leaving the naked darkness,
The virgin catches the gentle ray of scattered sunbeam
Come on; Adding a thirsty heart also breaks meditation.

Vibrating body-valve vibrating; Emotions
At the enchanted call, the mind-boat breathes out,
The river of lights at the pinnacle of the ornament of contentment;
A unknown magnetic emission in the cell!

The leaves of the Malti vine,
Which blossomed in the sleepless love of fire,
In the soft love poem;
In the blue canopy on the sand raft on the beach of love
Follows the trail of conch shells.</h4></pre></div>
