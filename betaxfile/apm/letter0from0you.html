    <div class="section"><pre><h4>I just received your letter,
Ever since I thought I would write you a letter
But I can't.
I couldn't find words of the letter.
You know, every time I went to write,
All of heart's arrogance came and stood in line,
But I never wanted to write you a haughty letter.
So it was never written to you.
You know where I am now with your letter?
Under our favorite royal poinciana tree.
The petals of poinciana have turned blue like the blue of your letter envelope.
Where did you find such a dark blue?
The heart doesn't want to tear this envelope at all,
Again, more than that, heart wants to drown in your letter.
What did you write in the letter?
Love mixed with your heart's desire or something else?

Finally I opened the envelope,
A white paper with four corners in the middle of the envelope.
A petal of gorgeous red rose across its middle.
Do you understand what my heart is feeling now?
All my favorite emotional feelings are gathered in one place.
The heart is shaking,
The mind is saying only one thing in an unspoken voice.
I love it ..................
The excitement that had been bothering me for so long,
Seemed to fade away in an instant.
Tears let out a cool sigh soaked in the drops of love.
I opened your letter.

You wrote ............
"Darkness I'm back"

That's all you wrote.
And in it I read all the love letters in the world.
I don't know if there is heaven on earth?
Don't want to know.
I don't know what happiness is,
People are happy when their desires are fulfilled.
I never had any desire.
Today I am happy to get what I didn't even wanted,
I am the only happy person in the world, I am happy to me.

You're coming! I don't know what to cook.
Do you still like to eat beef stew like before?
Or have you changed your taste? Shall I cook for you?
What should i wear,
I will wear the green saree
That you given in our first date, or another sari.
I don't understand whether I should apply Kajal with dark eyes or light.
You remember that bony prince of yours,
Which you gave on the first day of Spring?
I put him next to the south window of my house.
Now he has blossomed in the twigs.
I made a garland for you,
From which way will you come?
That way or any other way?

I am waiting for you at the south door .............. </h4></pre></div>
