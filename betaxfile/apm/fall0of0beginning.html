    <div class="section"><pre><h4>If human relationships are gradually deteriorating
If there is a gentle breeze, it will gradually subside
If earth's chest become house of cancer
Alas! God, the environment is absolutely corrupt.

If the word of love is unreasonable
If untouchable is the behavior of divine initiation
If stunned, birds dead body's shiver-
Alas! Love is incarnation of bastard.

If the island is strong in the new age
If the tone of the music is unobtrusively woven
If the involuntary weave is unwittingly offered
Alas! God of destruction - when it bursts forever.

If decay is no longer a diseassed
If the form is different
If sight gives bith of blindness
Alas! Embarrassment- What would be the fate of the human? </h4></pre></div>
