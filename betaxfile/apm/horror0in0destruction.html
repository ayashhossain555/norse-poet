    <div class="section"><pre><h4>Last spring I spoke at the door of horror,
The winter also passed with the hesitation of disagreement with the autumn.
If love is written in this rainy season
But so ...
You see horror, the season is over.
Your whims and desires do not allow me to find a match
So many words and demands are moving my mind today ...
Emotional protests are going on
Yet it is horrible to see you in this strike
You stand on the brink of destruction
And me?
I am nothing more

Just a peace-loving vagabond
Who captures the sad butterflies in the chest of his heart
Do you know what I do with that, horror?
You will hide your face and smile when you hear it
But to be honest
The blue color of melancholy draws you on the canvas of my heart
Over and over
A thousand times
Draws you
Yet you are on the brink of destruction today

If you stop talking
Poems that will not set me free
Hundreds more will put me in a black prison on white paper

I don't have much trouble
All the despair and misery of tomorrow makes me very tired
Yet you give hope
Your words give me hope
But speechless?
Why horror?
Even from the wish of the death of a defeated soldier
I hope for your words more

I am not the first poet
I drew a picture of your words without any pen
I can't finish that in a thousand words
I can't capture it in a thousand pages
You have seen the last frontier of infinity, horror
If it starts from the horizon
Tell me where the end will be
Today, however, I wrote no more
Let some sentences remain unspoken
Not all the last sentences brings end, horror,
Some sentences leaves beginning of a hundred sentences .... </h4></pre></div>
