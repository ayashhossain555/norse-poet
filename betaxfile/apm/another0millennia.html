    <div class="section"><pre><h4>In another millennia I will be a flower, you become a butterfly
A millennium will pass by me like this
To make infinite suffering the essence of love
I will be the voice of the earth, that day you ..
Come as rain, take the scent of love.

The poverty of this millennium has disillusioned me
Hunger, poverty, famine, war, despair, unemployment, and betrayal
My heart is a cage of ugly pain
Yet I live in the bondage of affection
Love was her name, not peace.

In the new millennium I will rise under the care of a sweet child ,
Not in the garden, away from the village -
Across the road to mountain village
In the cool chest of white clouds on the top of a hill
No clade of soil and people will reach those mountains
You will easily touch my pure petals
Come as a butterfly, in the midst of joy.

This episode of ours is accumulated in invisible ether
The children of love and affctione have crossed the river of hope
Why don't you wake up? If you wake up again
Before another destruction, you become an artist
You will find me on the canvas of nature. </h4></pre></div>
