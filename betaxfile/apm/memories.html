I tied you to the sheet of my dreams
I got you in my mind
I have drawn you in the color of my heart

The first day we met
Me with you
When you open festival of words
No name to stop.

Not annoyed, there was fascination
In that look of mine
I thought I understood this
I'm drowning in your smile

You were very arrogant
And I was stupid
Yet that was the moment
Most expensive to me

The feeling of first love is mine
Was very colorful
I did not understand the destination then
Easy or difficult

Maybe a little more hopeful
I wanted more from you
Love is either not or given
Do you have anything else to say?

Love me
Everything is yours
I will give unconditionally,
A little caress
A little affection
Will I get it?
Instead of all the pieces... </h4></pre></div>
