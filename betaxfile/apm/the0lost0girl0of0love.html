    <div class="section"><pre><h4>Even the most ordinary flower sometimes becomes extraordinary,
The three-eyed human being transcends the boundaries of time,
You are one of those very ordinary people,
You can be loved, not found!
Easy to lose you, intense desire to get!
Who are you?

Twenty-two billion years ago,
One fell on this earth, the footprints of the primitive woman -
So much research on that!
Sweaty researcher in the laboratory seraching day and night,
Sure no one can say anything.
A young middle-aged foreign researcher of the 21st century
Was also addicted to small archeological studies from east to west.
Anumita, how far are you today?

Twenty-two crore years later,
In the shadowy body of that primitive woman,
Leaving the veil of Bibi Hawa, Mary and Radha,
I understand the pain of Laili-Majnu, did you came?
No one recognized you.
There was another footprint beside you.
No one saw it!
Did not know the longing of this heart!

At the turn of the century,
No one could say anything after confirming the research meeting of the researched data.
No investigation report was submitted.
President, musicologist also did not recognize,
The underlying significance of the archaeological survey.
She was all here and got reincarnated
again , again and again
This is how an ethnic civilization of love lives..

But she kept walking, kept walking ....
Will walk another twenty-two billion years.
Poet spends time in response to that day. </h4></pre></div>
