    <div class="section"><pre><h4>The sun has risen in the drought torn city,
Blue stories have wings in the middle of the heart,
Today the pains are careless,
Empty bodies in the world of wounded words,
Yet I ...
Sitting among the conscious, anxiously waiting.

Dead city in the foggy spring,
Birds are flying in a procession of blood,
Goddess looking for an empty mind in an empty path,
Lover of love on the way to the forest of love today,
Yet I ...
Sitting in the midst of fantasies, detached.

The time has passed today in a very cruel and sad city,
In the evening the poison of the clouds is extinguished,
Dead scent coming from the building wall,
In the daily dustbin, flowers blooming in search of insect food,
Yet I .....
I am sitting in the middle of emptiness, subject.

Bloody city without money,
Innocent flowers are like falling petals today,
Sewer worms are now benefactors of virtue,
Borders, black goods, seals of goods,
Yet I ...
I am sitting in the middle of the story, absolutely.

Rainy streams today in this dark city of great indifference,
The arrogant mind of the cloudy sky is anxious and silly.
Imagine the rain falling in the dark night today,
The story of the rainstorm is no longer heard in the still alley,
Yet I ...
I'm sitting in the middle of the southern horizon,
Waiting for a little warmth ...... </h4></pre></div>
