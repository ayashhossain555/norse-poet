    <div class="section"><pre><h4>I thought, when the days of terror in this world are over,
Or if life is lost in captivity.
The audacity of this helplessness
I will take refuge far away from your sight.
I will never knock on your door again.

Darkness,
I don't want to poison you in my sad life,
So you are free in this sense.
You are a bird with wings in the open sky,
So the sky around the world is yours.
The rubbish that I have thrown away,
So I am big mismatch in your sky.

Are you hearing, darkness!
I want your new lover to come to your town and love you.
The fragrance of your love spreads all over the city.
I will not become a thorn in the side of the embankment.


Life full of laughter-cry, happiness-sorrow, anger, pride,
No longer I will want you.
I'm really saying, roses in your garden,
I will not fall off like petals.
I gave what I had to give,
I burned you more than love.
So I tell you again, darkness,
From today you are free from me .

Darkness,
Don't ever think of me,
I am now hiding a far away
From lot of your happiness and sorrow.
I went to that unknown address,
To lose myself, with the empty boat.
Stay happy darkness
With your newborn love ... </h4></pre></div>
