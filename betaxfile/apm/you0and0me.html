    <div class="section"><pre><h4>In the sense of thousands of words
In the middle of a hundred lines of verse,
Oh Love I love you,
How much more to love.

You don't understand, you don't understand me,
Made a dream of sweet lies.
You said, love me,
What's left to act.

I was blind, I was deaf, I was deceived by your affection.
Did you see me drowning?
I'm dying for your separation.

You are arrogant, your arrogance
Don't I have a little right?
All the anger in your name?
Am I as playful as you?

I had a love of governance
The reason was to listen
I just wanted to be good
Avoid this rule to you.

Was my love so bitter,
What do you need so much?
I will leave, you will not find me
Our story is midway through...... </h4></pre></div>
