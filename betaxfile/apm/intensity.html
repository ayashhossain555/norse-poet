    <div class="section"><pre><h4>Darkness,
After seeing you, I thought, for so long
I have been a sculptor without vibrations.
It was as if the whole world, the stagnant universe,
And the colorless form of stationary,
Nature were standing before my lifeless eyes;
And there was life, a white canvas.
Then, one day you came with a great hearing.
A strange vibration called love in the heart of a young girl who is young!
I got lost in the emptiness, regained my life.

Darkness,
Your whole being and the killer's eyes are terrible
From inanimate objects to sinking deeper,
I became a devoted lover;
 Tough and tough.
I loved it, Darkness.
A heart
As much as his world is decorated with love,
Maybe I loved him with a little more.


Just a few days, darkness.
Finally your steady departure.
Kissing your Kajal painted eyes,
I never said, "Come on, build the world";
And,
There is no love, no entity other than you.
O dark girl, in love with you,
At last
From the sculpture I am one dead ruin today;
Where love survives with a smile;
Lonely, lonely and in the most intense pain .... </h4></pre></div>
