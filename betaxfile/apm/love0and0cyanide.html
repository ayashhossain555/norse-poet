    <div class="section"><pre><h4>Cyanide made a treaty that would kill the soul,
But
What happened in an instant?
I don't understand, Beloved.
The poet's name in alphabetical order on the tombstone.

Got it, Beloved?
Cyanide was adulterated like you?
Or the body has accidentally died in place of the soul?
In fact, the soul never dies -
Just traveling from one world to another.

Now think what will happen to a lost soul!
Whatever has happened has already happened;
The poet did not want to live in that city of love
Where he must live without seeing your face.

Beloved,
Take a look if you can,
Leave some flowers, two drops of salty water in the grave;
But I want you to dress up by pressing Kajal and black
Don't forget to wear that red saree with it.

Forget it,
The poet does not want to see the face of the liar,
Well, either the foolish poet sat alone;
Beloved,
Rather, you are on the brink of old memories
A matchstick, touch it in memory of the poet. </h4></pre></div>
