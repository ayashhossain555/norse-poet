All spirits, wicked,
Hides the real look,
The smile on their face is still false.

In the crowd of thousands, I drowned
No one cares
Save me, I'm here
Here I am, speechless ...

I'm tired, I'm looking for you
Walking down this road.
I wonder, how far?
But again the day is over

Today in the desert of zero sapphires,
Black and white
That's why I raised my hand,
Will you give me completion? </h4></pre></div>
