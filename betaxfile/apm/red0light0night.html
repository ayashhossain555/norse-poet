    <div class="section"><pre><h4>The race just started
The desperate attempt to catch the entity
As soon as he reached, he grabbed the collar of her back

And where to escape little pray
Tons of hot fibers in the anus
He chased after her naked flower
Lustfully pulled the wire of temptation
Riding on the back like an advantage

Then, in anger, rage, and greed, the trafficking is crushed
The white river relieves the pressure of winter
Ah, the same shame to die
I understand that this adjustment bed will be lost
After a successful recovery, the wolf stood up
Losing a lot of happiness in a great mood,
Sweaty garbage was immediately thrown away
As if there is nothing to feel unclean
putting the drop of sin to fill the birth
This arrest is just a trivial matter
Then the rotten flower stared happily with humility
The two of them walk together, in private
At the end of the farewell, the mind says this-
Let's meet again in the realm of love. </h4></pre></div>
