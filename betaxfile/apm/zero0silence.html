However, I got the acting right,
Just like you do ... !!
Got it, you're not good with me,
Darkness,
You wasn't in my goodbyes,
Was in my arms and smiles .. !!

I was trapped in loneliness ..!
So, I didn't answer you a hundred times,
On the contrary, in the midst of a lot of business
If you give me deportation forever ..!
Tell me what to do, darkness,
Even today, in the corner of my mind,
Feelings go on silently .. !!
And he said, "I still love today."

Condemnation and wailing ..
I could never explain to you ..!
Is that really so?
Or, you just didn't want to understand, darkness?
No, it's not yours, it's my failure ..!
What else did I know,
Why is your life so cruel ..!

I know I pushed you too far,
But I did not know! Darkness, in heart of yours...
The red rose in hand
You can see the emptiness in my eyes ... !!

Darkness,
My color has shifted to your sky,
From that endless dark sidewalk ..!
I forgot today,
How to give rain-soaked buds .. !!

The sores on your eyes and your silence
Even today it eats me up ..!
Yet, at times it seems like a sea
Someone understands and wants to go back .. !!
Can't believe it, darkness !!
Would you pull me in again,
My song floats to a new tune ..!
Or the history of separation will continue to be written,
In my emptiness, in my silence ..... </h4></pre></div>
