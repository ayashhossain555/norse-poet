    <div class="section"><pre><h4>I may not love you

If you love, you have to express a provocative look,
The body is touched,
Lust has to play with naked existence in a demonic manner,
You have to get breasts like Rabindranath's erotic poem,

In the end,
Naked love has to be thrown into the dustbin of time with a semen-filled condom.

I couldn't!
Standing against the current is just a failure

I wanted to create a reflection of pure love with intense desire where-
I paid the price of a bunch of naked honor for the failure there

If this is your love
Leave it at that,
I'm not blind
I will fly like colored smoke.
If this is your love
Leave it at that,
I will sit in the middle of the night
And match the puzzle of emptiness .. </h4></pre></div>
