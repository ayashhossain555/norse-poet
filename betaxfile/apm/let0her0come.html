Is the storm cpming?
Is the cloud quareling again?
Let them come.

Let her come,
Is the nature in destruction?
Is the winds singing the song of union?
Is the waves getting rebelious?
Let her come.

If there is any light in the storm,
If there any hope in destruction,
If I get to see the sweetest breeze in love,
Let her love. </h4></pre></div>
