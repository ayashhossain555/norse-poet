    <div class="section"><pre><h4>How long have I been in asking the sky,
When will she come?
The sky did not answer
I think my clouds are frozen,
No one was looking for her.
Sky cried one day,
I realized that sweet rain was falling all over the city in my mind,
I opened the south corner window
While waiting to see her for a moment, heart gets rain.

As soon as darkness sets foot in my city,
I know why the city gets wet.
My eyes are very restless,
The crazy mind runs to her way again and again
They let me see her,
But I do not know why.
I am standing in the dark,
Why the glass wall in the middle!
Even today it is in an unknown dark story.

Asked her,
What happened to you! Darkness?
Darkness was unresponsive,
I said,
They said you can't be caught anymore.
She said take care of yourself beloved,
I said, but are you running away?
she said an invisible monster has arrived,
This body is caught on all sides.
It's over when you touch it.
You stay alive, stay well dear!
When the earth is healthy,
Call for me to the way of the sky.
Again, look for me in the pouring rain,
I will wait in that dark cloud,
Sometimes it rains,
I will lie in the dark water on a rainy canvas .... </h4></pre></div>
