    <div class="section"><pre><h4>You are a good man.
You can make a bad word out of a brothel,
Even if you forget in the light of day,
You do not keep your feet in the promise of prostitution.
You are a gentleman
Who has covered his desires in a poster of politeness in front of everyone.
You can again breathe silently in the darkness of the night,
Satisfying the desire on the breast of a prostitute.
You know how to take demonic pleasure
Even by biting the teeth on the flesh of her body.
Again, licking the lust of the tongue
From her legs to the vagina does not bind your lips.
Just saying two truths in her name just binds your lips.
You are a "good man".
You forgot someone else in your name,
Someone on the forehead with vermilion
The one with whom you took oath of life
She is busy praying again only for your well-being.
After the night you stay awake till dawn in response.
You are looking for a woman who is immersed in the woman of the body.
Your child in the womb of a prostitute ...!
As much as you are reluctant to accept this truth ...
You are a good man ...!
Good societies's tidy "Gentleman".
