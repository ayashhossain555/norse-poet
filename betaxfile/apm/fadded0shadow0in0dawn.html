    <div class="section"><pre><h4>I know , darkness,
Nothing lasts forever on this drama stage.
The shadow of my five-foot-nine-inch body will one day decay.
Like pickle
No one can stop my shadow,
I have to leave.

I know , darkness,
The edge of this paved pond, the waves of cloudy water,
Mango tree full of buds, no one can stop my shadow.
A group of fireflies burning in the litchi garden on a balmy night,
Or the sound of insects
The shadow, will fail to stop, no matter how it feels,
I don't understand.


I know , darkness,
My shadow will never fall like a rose petal.
But then what will happen! Darkness?
Will everyone hurt the shadow!?
But then the existence of the shadow will disappear in this arena!
No one will ever remember the shadow!

I know , darkness,
My thin shadow will blend into this silent light.
But who will shout? Darkness!
Whom the memory of my shadow will weep bitterly, morning-evening!
Someone stood at the south door, shouting.
Two eyes opened, both hands extended waiting for the shadow?

But before leaving, the shadow,
Something like the last poem can be said,
You know what! Darkness?
It can be said,
Listen to the life of the new dawn,
I am going to say death as the last breath of the city--
Lovers have to love ... </h4></pre></div>
