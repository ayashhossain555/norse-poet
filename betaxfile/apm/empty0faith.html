Unbearably restless time passes

I don't know why it happens sometimes
Bored time spent in indifferent proximity

I don't know why sometimes my color is emotional
Lives clear time with great affection

All morning- noon evening- night
Devotion is the heavenly right

Constantly breathing
Spend time in incredible faith. </h4></pre></div>
