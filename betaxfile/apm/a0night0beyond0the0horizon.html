    <div class="section"><pre><h4>What a blessing, night and we are alone!
The river is like a mirror and the whole star glitters;
And then...throw your head and look,
What depth and purity above us!

Oh, call me crazy!
Give what you want,
At that moment I am weakening
In my mind and in my heart I feel such a surge of love,
That I can’t be silent, I won’t, I don’t know how!

I'm sick, I'm in love but tormented and loving---
Oh, listen! Understand!
I do not hide passion,
And I want to say that I love you,
You, I alone love you and wish you!

No, I have not changed.
To a deep old age
I am the same devotee,
I am a slave to your love,
And the old poison of chains,
Rejoicing and cruel,
Still burns in my blood.

Though the memory insists that there is a grave between us,
Though every day I rave languidly to another,
I can’t believe that you will forget me,
When you are here, in front of me.

Whether other beauty flickers for a moment,
I wonder, about to recognize you;
And I hear the tenderness of the past,
And, shuddering, I sing.

I won’t tell you anything,
I won’t worry you at all,
And that I will silently hold out,
I will not dare to hint for anything.

Night flowers sleep all day,
But only the sun sets behind the grove,
The sheets are quietly revealed,
And I hear my heart blooming.

And in a sick tired chest
Blowing nightly moisture... I tremble.
I will only meet your smile
Or I will catch your gratifying gaze.

I don’t sing you a love song,
But your beloved beauty.
They say about the singer in the dawn,
As if a rose is in love with a trill in sweet poison!

I am glad to praise relentlessly
Over your fragrant cradle.
Only a song needs beauty,
Beauty doesn’t need a song, though. </h4></pre></div>
